Develop Locally:
- `make develop`

This first pulls all the app settings from the function app and saves them to the local.settings.json file.
Most settings are set in the terraform file, under the azurerm_linux_function_app resource.
Then it builds the project and starts the function app in debug mode.

Deploy to Azure:
- `make deploy`

This builds the project and publishes it to the function app.
