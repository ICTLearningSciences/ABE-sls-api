export const documentStart = `Albert King’s name is very fitting, as he is seen as one of the many kings of the blues. Making strides and leaving marks in the genre not just during but even after his life proves how crucial King was to the expansion of the blues. He was not born into the wealthiest of families but that was not enough to keep King from following the sound of music; he created his first “instrument” out of a cigar box when he was a child. He also sang in the gospel group at his local church, that of which his father played the guitar in. Though, these were only his humble beginnings. When King was 27, he was introduced to the owner of the t-99 nightclub in his home state, where he joined the inhouse band.
He garnered popularity thanks to his unique sound, and quickly he was headlining many clubs in his area. He would go on to be signed with Stax Records, and under that label, deliver many tracks that are considered to this day to be classics, such as “Cross Cut Saw” and “Born Under a Bad Sign.” King continued his stardom and gained national attention, and by the end of his career, he was touring America and Europe until his sudden death in 1992(Erlewine). Albert King’s sudden death did not erase his history nor dwindle the impact that he has had on music. He was inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013, showing that he has still not been forgotten and will forever be recognized as an inspiration to everything music and  as a crucial part in musics history(RockHall).
Albert King’s has had an immense inspiration on other artists, so much so that artist Eric Clapton copied one of King’s guitar solos, note for note, without any sort of permission. This is obviously a violation of copyright infringement. There are ways to “sample” music without copyright infringement, such as through transformative use, meaning the “new work considerably adds to the original or turns it into something new”(Pack). Now this could mean that if an artist is able to sample another's music, but add enough of their own content to it, it would not be copyright infringement, meaning the one sampling the music would not have to give credit to the original artist.
Kanye West, famous for his use of sampling others music, has found himself in a few lawsuits, as expected when treading in the gray area of sampling music. Kanye, along with other big artists, usually have no trouble when it comes to gaining clearance (permission from the copyright owner and original artist to sample their song,) but smaller artists and smaller labels run into trouble(Stim). Most artists charge an upfront fee and an extra percentage of royalties for the song. Not only that, but most big labels won't even consider let alone give a response to the smaller labels requesting clearance. These premises could lead to smaller artists taking risks with their music, leading to hefty lawsuits and careers being put on the line(Pack).
I personally believe that using another's property for financial gain should be seen as morally wrong. Of course, though, there are exceptions to every rule. If the artist that is sampling is able to make the sample seem like such a small or even insignificant part of their song, then nothing morally wrong is being committed. Now, one could see how Eric Clapton's copy of Albert King’s guitar solo is morally wrong, as it is a near exact replication of it, and with no recognition of the original artists, it is a clear representation of greed. This is simply not a “sample” of Albert King’s property, but the whole dish. This is the difference between tracing a drawing, and performing your own rendition of it. In the gray area of sampling, it is safest and best to use your favorite artist as inspiration, and nothing more.
